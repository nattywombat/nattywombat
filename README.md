### Hi there 👋 - GitHub Rookie here...

###### This is my first addition to my repo.  I love 🏕️, 🚴‍♀️, 🥾 and all the things that happen outdoors.  Oh, and wombats, I love wombats.  
If I want to practice styles, I would do it like this:

[ ] **Bold**

[ ] *Italics*

> don't quote me on this 😄

If you want to learn about wombats, visit them on their [wiki!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat)
- Not sure why my nickname became that
- now it is here to stay forever as my handle
- *special note: a group of wombats is called a wisdom*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat sometimes you want more ***emphasis*** without linking something but just laying it out there for all to see

**nattywombat/nattywombat** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning GitHub!  How did we do any of this without YouTube and Google?!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I competed in the World Championship for Duathlon in Denmark for Team USA in 2018 and 3 months later completed my first full Ironman (I am now retired from all that and considering a re-entry into it this year)
