### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**nattywombat/nattywombat** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning GitHub!  How did we do any of this without YouTube and Google?!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I competed in the World Championship for Duathlon in Denmark for Team USA in 2018 and 3 months later completed my first full Ironman (I am now retired from all that and considering a re-entry into it this year)
